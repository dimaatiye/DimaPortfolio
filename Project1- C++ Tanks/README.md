# Tank Game
This game, developed in C++, puts you in an action-packed tank battle where your mission is clear: outsmart and defeat the enemy tank before it takes you down!

## How to Play
- Move your tank: Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to navigate the battlefield.

- Control your turret: Use Z, X, and C to aim your turret and line up your shots.

- Shoot the enemy: Hit the enemy tank 5 times to win the game.

- Avoid getting hit: The enemy tank follows your movements, so watch your back—if it touches you, it’s game over!

## Objective
Survive and outsmart the enemy tank to claim victory. Quick thinking, precise aiming, and clever movement are the keys to winning.
