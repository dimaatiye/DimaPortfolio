# Growing Tree Adventure

**Growing Tree Adventure** is a browser-based game built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The game opens with a form where you enter your name, and it remembers returning players. The goal is to **grow your tree to win** while surviving various obstacles.  

## Objective
- Avoid skeletons to stay alive.  
- Collect leaves to gain points.  
- Collect energy items to keep your tree growing.  
- Manage your time carefully — there’s a **timer** to track your progress.  

## Gameplay
1. Enter your name in the form. Returning players are remembered.  
2. Navigate the canvas to collect leaves and energy items.  
3. Avoid skeletons — colliding with them reduces your energy or can end the game.  
4. Use collected items to grow your tree and reach the win condition before time runs out.  

## Technology
- **HTML** for structure and form input.  
- **CSS** for styling the page and game elements.  
- **JavaScript (Canvas API)** for game logic, rendering, and interactive elements.  
- Local storage is used to **remember returning players**.
